# Microsoft Professional Program Notes

These notes cover the main topics for various courses which make up the Microsoft Professional Programs. I have tried to keep them as brief as possible. They are primarily meant to be a refresher (especially for spaced repetition) rather than as a resource for people just learning the course.

Feel free to submit pull requests to fix mistakes or add other courses.
